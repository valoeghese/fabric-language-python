# Fabric Language Python

You will need jep 4.0.0 (built from source using visual studio build tools 2017 (search it up online you'll find it somewhere)) installed (installation and build instructions on jep's getting started page). Do **not** use pip to install jep, that version is *outdated*.

https://github.com/ninia/jep/wiki/Getting-Started

Follow the instructions to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH (not windows) or -Djava.library.path to your built shared library and put the python files where they belong. (latter should have automatically been done with install)

I might make a proper installer for this one day using the built files on my end but effort.

You need a python 3.x version
